# lttp-tracker
This is a fork of the tracker at https://lttp-tracker.firebaseapp.com/

If you want to modify that version, you need to re-host it yourself on firebase, which is a big hassle. This version can easily be tweaked and changed locally. This meant taking out the networking features that let you do things like have a stream viewer run your tracker for you.
