# lttp-tracker
This is an item tracker for LTTP: Randomizer. Use it at https://hyphen-ated.github.io/lttp-tracker/

This is a fork of the tracker at ```https://lttp-tracker.firebaseapp.com/```

If you want to modify that version, you need to re-host it yourself on firebase, which is a big hassle. This version can easily be tweaked and changed locally. This meant taking out the networking features that let you do things like have a stream viewer run your tracker for you.
